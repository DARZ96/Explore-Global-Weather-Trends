# Explore Global Weather Trends

## Summary 
Analyzed local and global temperature data and compared the 
temperature trends of Madrid, Spain to overall global temperature 
trends.

## Dataset
For this project, I queried a database with the following tables: 
- city_list - This contains a list of cities and countries in the database.
- city_data - This contains the average temperatures for each city by year (ºC).
- global_data - This contains the average global temperatures by year (ºC).

## Questions Posed 

- Is Madrid hotter or cooler on average compared to the global average? Has the difference been consistent over time?
- How do the changes in Madrid's temperatures over time compare to the changes in the global average?
- What does the overall trend look like? Is the world getting hotter or cooler? Has the trend been consistent over the last few hundred years?
- What's the correlation coefficient?
- Can the average temperature in Madrid be estimate based on the average global temperature?
